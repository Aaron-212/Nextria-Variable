# Nextria Variable

An experimental Sans to Serif typeface based on Inria Sans and Inria Serif.

> Definitely not inspired by ABC Dinamo Arizona.

Sans typeface is 90% ready, just need to fix some incompatible glyphs.
Serif typeface? 0%, I'm trying.

Available axes:
- `wght`: Weight
- `slnt`: Slant
- `SRIF`: Serif (Custom Axis)
